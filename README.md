# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple yet powerful To-Do List web application built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The app allows users to add, remove, and track tasks in a user-friendly interface. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate key web development concepts including task management, state handling, and building interactive UIs.


## Features

- **React**: Built using React for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and efficient build tool used to bundle the app for production.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Includes a dark mode toggle for user preference.
- **To-Do List**: A simple to-do list application where users can manage their tasks.
- **Terms and Privacy Pages**: Static pages for Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
- **Completed Tasks Display**: Completed tasks are displayed in a separate section.
- **State Management**: Task data is handled via React's built-in state.
